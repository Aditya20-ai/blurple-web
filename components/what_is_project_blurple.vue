        What is Project Blurple?
      </h1>

      <p>
        If you've got this far, you might have some idea, but what exactly is Project Blurple?
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Project Blurple is simple at its core, we're here to celebrate Discord's birthday each year with the community.
          We do this by encouraging folks to participate in our Discord server, chatting, entering giveaways and
          joining in with any events we run there.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The other big thing we do is asking those celebrating with us to make their avatars and server icons Blurple
        colored. Blurple is Discord's main brand color and by having everyone change their images to use a color scheme
        based on this, we can show our appreciation for Discord outside the Project Blurple server.
      </p>

      <p>
        Discord's birthday is on May 13th, so Project Blurple normally launches roughly a week before to get the
        community hyped and ready to celebrate, with the main partying happening on May 13th. Things wrap up quickly
        after that with the final few giveaways being done in the following couple of days.

      <p>
        Project Blurple started in 2018 to celebrate Discord's 3rd birthday and has happened each year since, becoming
        more organised and much larger each year. 2018 saw a massive initial splash with 15,000 Blurple users that
        year and over 3,400 servers participating. 2019 was a bit quieter with only 4k Blurple users and just
        over 400 servers involved.

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          We're back for 2020 and we're already on track to have the biggest event so far, with over 3.3k Blurple users
          marking themselves as participating with a Blurple themed avatar in the first day!
